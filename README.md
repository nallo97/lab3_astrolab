# lab3_astrolab

Overall steps:
1. Download a mission (HM1 or HM2) for now off of http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#maps (CMB Maps)
  - Stick the data in a "data/" folder and name the file in the notebook accordingly
2. Run through notebook and plot using healpy (use conda to install) 
  - Ordering is nested! Otherwise you get a wack graph
  - anafast does the job for us! While this works, we should try implementing our own version?
3. Find some "easy enough" model that lets us get some parameters without CAMB. Check Hu\& White 1996.
