# lab3_astrolab

Overall steps:
1. Download a mission (HM1 or HM2) for now off of http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/#maps (CMB Maps)
  - Stick the data in a "data/" folder and name the file in the notebook accordingly
2. Run through notebook and plot using healpy (use conda to install) 
  - Ordering is nested! Otherwise you get a wack graph
3. anafast does the job for us! While this works, we should try implementing our own version?
